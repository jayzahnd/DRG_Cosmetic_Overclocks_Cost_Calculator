## Deep Rock Galactic cosmetic Overclocks cost calculator

A simple Windows console application to quickly calculate the resources needed for crafting cosmetic overclocks, whether as a whole or by type. This was made in the early days of Rival Incursion (season 1), so many cosmetics aren't included in the wikidata files of this repo. Note that this was a quick thing I did solely for my own use and to edit the wiki information page by providing total costs in 2021, so it's a rough around the edges and limited in functionality.

How to make/edit your own wikidata files:

1. Head over to the [Matrix Core cosmetics' section in the wiki](https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki/Accessory_Shop#Matrix_Core_Cosmetics):
2. Copy the content of each item category table in separate files (+ 1 containing all table contents combined).
3. Ensure the naming convention for the files is recognised by the code and you should be good to go.

Why use several txt files instead of only 1 that would filter? No reason, this would have to be redone.
